	<h2>üßë‚Äçüßë‚Äçüßí‚Äçüßí Group Work</h2>

	<p>During our first group meeting, we introduced ourselves so that everyone could understand each other's backgrounds and present study field. After the introductions, all the team members started suggesting ideas on how we should approach this task knowing the extra input from Edwin: "This time think about some robots that would be useful to <b><i>you</i></b>". My first proposal in this case was that we look into the robots that we all know and love from different scenarios like animated shows, movies, games or real life.</p>

	<p>After examining some popular robot characters such as WALL-E, R2-D2, Baymax, Claptrap or the Personality Cores from the Portal game series (Portal ones being my favourite, links at the bottom if you wish to check them out) we tried to understand why these robots are so liked by the people. The conclusion we have arrived to is that despite some of them no being able to talk like R2-D2 and WALL-E, they all have well-developed "personalities" and show artificial emotions, which is a key reason for their appeal.</p>
