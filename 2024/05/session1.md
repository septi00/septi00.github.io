# Session 1 - Design Tools

## üßë‚Äçüßë‚Äçüßí‚Äçüßí Group Work

During our first group meeting, we introduced ourselves so that everyone could understand each other's backgrounds and present study field. After the introductions, all the team members started suggesting ideas on how we should approach this task knowing the extra input from Edwin: "This time think about some robots that would be useful to _you_". My first proposal in this case was that we look into the robots that we all know and love from different scenarios like animated shows, movies, games or real life.

After examining some popular robot characters such as WALL-E, R2-D2, Baymax, Claptrap or the Personality Cores from the Portal game series (Portal ones being my favourite, links at the bottom if you wish to check them out) we tried to understand why these robots are so liked by the people. The conclusion we have arrived to is that despite some of them no being able to talk like R2-D2 and WALL-E, they all have well-developed "personalities" and show artificial emotions, which is a key reason for their appeal.

<img src="images/calptrap.png" alt="A descriptive image" style= "max-width: 25%">
</div>

Based on this conclusion we tried to find some real-life robots that show similar traits. We found some, either in development like Samsung's Ballie (I'm wondering where that name came from), or already available for purchase such as Vector.

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="images/ballie.png" alt="A descriptive image" style= "max-width: 45%">
<img src="images/vector.png" alt="A descriptive image" style= "max-width: 43.6%">
</div>

Drawing inspiration from these robot characters, we then define the traits and capabilities we wished our robot would inherit and aimed to create a robot that could not only perform tasks efficiently but also possess an engaging personality that would allow the robot to emotionally connect with the user

While doing so we put together the following mind map:

## ‚ùìReflective Questions

**1. Which pointers does this chapter give in/to a design research approach?**


**2. What general statements can be made regarding embodiment vs digital content. Apparently users are very capable of maintaining (and living and being assisted by) a boxy thing with a screen. Do we need actuators? Which part of embodiment turns a smartphone into a social robot?**

**3. Now restate your answer on the previous question after watching the movie 'her'. (the trailer is already a good hint if you didn't know the movie) Does this change your perspective?**

**4. If you now compare the work (vincent2015) with the overview by Bar-Cohen et.al.(with a more gripping title) The coming robot revolution23) which differences in focus can you point out? This work is a decade old. Where did the real world deviate from the predicted revolution?**

**5. Read about the robot hotel - and compare their practice against for example the heavily automated CitizenM hotel. Where did the robot hotel went wrong?**

**6. Consider the story of the Nabaztag rabbit. The 'internet made social' in 2009. A physical embodiment as user interface for the internet of things. How does this fit definitions of social robot technology? Where does it deviate? No, why was it not successful?**

**7. Check out the work on cuddlebits paper - what are key insights in the role and application of design research in this project?**
