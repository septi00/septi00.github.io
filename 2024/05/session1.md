# Session 1 - Design Tools

## üßë‚Äçüßë‚Äçüßí‚Äçüßí Group Work

During our first group meeting, we introduced ourselves so that everyone could understand each other's backgrounds and
present study field. After the introductions, all the team members started suggesting ideas on how we should approach
this task knowing the extra input from Edwin: "This time think about some robots that would be useful to _you_". My
first proposal in this case was that we look into the robots that we all know and love from different scenarios like
animated shows, movies, games or real life.

After examining some popular robot characters such as WALL-E, R2-D2, Baymax, Claptrap or the Personality Cores from the
Portal game series (Portal ones being my favourite, links at the bottom if you wish to check them out) we tried to
understand why these robots are so liked by the people. The conclusion we have arrived to is that despite some of them
no being able to talk like R2-D2 and WALL-E, they all have well-developed "personalities" and show artificial emotions,
which is a key reason for their appeal.

<img src="images/calptrap.png" alt="A descriptive image" style= "max-width: 25%">
</div>

Based on this conclusion we tried to find some real-life robots that show similar traits. We found some, either in
development like Samsung's Ballie (I'm wondering where that name came from), or already available for purchase such as
Vector.

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="images/ballie.png" alt="A descriptive image" style= "max-width: 45%">
<img src="images/vector.png" alt="A descriptive image" style= "max-width: 43.6%">
</div>

Drawing inspiration from these robot characters, we then define the traits and capabilities we wished our robot would
inherit and aimed to create a robot that could not only perform tasks efficiently but also possess an engaging
personality that would allow the robot to emotionally connect with the user

While doing so we put together the following mind map:

## ‚ùìReflective Questions

**1. Which pointers does this chapter give in/to a design research approach?**

**2. What general statements can be made regarding embodiment vs digital content. Apparently users are very capable of
maintaining (and living and being assisted by) a boxy thing with a screen. Do we need actuators? Which part of
embodiment turns a smartphone into a social robot?**

Some of the pointers for a design research approach for social robotics provided by the book are:

* A way to categorize humanoid robot types based on whether they are 2D or 3D, and still or moving. This can help
  designers think through the different robot types and shapes systematically.
* Key issues designers should consider like: the intuitiveness and user-friendliness of the robot's interface, the
  relation between the robot's expressions with and the normal human communication, the creepy feeling for robots
  that look too human-like
* Ways that open-source technologies and the "maker" community enable more designers to work on social robots by
  increasing access to open robot hardware/software combining design, building, and user testing in collaborative
  processes using online communities for feedback and iterations.

The need for a multidisciplinary approach drawing from technology, psychology, robotics, ethics etc. to properly tackle
the complex design challenges.

**3. Now restate your answer on the previous question after watching the movie 'her'. (the trailer is already a good
hint if you didn't know the movie) Does this change your perspective?**

**4. If you now compare the work (vincent2015) with the overview by Bar-Cohen et.al.(with a more gripping title) The
coming robot revolution23) which differences in focus can you point out? This work is a decade old. Where did the real
world deviate from the predicted revolution?**

**5. Read about the robot hotel - and compare their practice against for example the heavily automated CitizenM hotel.
Where did the robot hotel went wrong?**

**6. Consider the story of the Nabaztag rabbit. The 'internet made social' in 2009. A physical embodiment as user
interface for the internet of things. How does this fit definitions of social robot technology? Where does it deviate?
No, why was it not successful?**

**7. Check out the work on cuddlebits paper - what are key insights in the role and application of design research in
this project?**
